# spartan-nvim
A spartan neovim config focused on efficiency and usability rather than looks

## Warning
This config is not in a state where it should be used yet. I'm building it right now and not using it to be productive. There are missing features I'd like to include and possibly bugs that need to be ironed out.

## Lore
This is a personal project of mine, the neovim config that I'm using. I'm putting it on github first to have versioning and easy syncing between devices for me, and for other people secondary.
This is not intended to be a distribution in any way. If the repo helps or inspires you I'm happy, but I won't implement features I do not need. The repo is MIT licensed for a reason, everyone
can take its contents and achieve their own goals with it.
